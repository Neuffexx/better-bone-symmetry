# Better Bone Symmetry
Symmetrize extra Bone data in Blender.

## Description
I was getting tired of running multiple scripts to copy over more data when symmetrizing bones.  
Therefore I put it all into one addon, though this does not replace the built in 'Symmetrize' tool.  
Bust is intended to be used after the built in one.

## Features:
- Symmetrize Bone Collections
  - Assign to Parent Collections (up the hierarchy)  
    *This is a workaround to allow you to solo nested collections, from the Top-Parent collection.
- Symmetrize Bone Constraints (WIP)
- Symmetrize Drivers (WIP)
